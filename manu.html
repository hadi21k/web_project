                        <p>Predictive maintenance is a proactive maintenance strategy that uses machine learning and
                            other data-driven methods to predict when equipment is likely to fail. The goal of
                            predictive maintenance is to prevent equipment failures before they occur, reducing downtime
                            and maintenance costs, and improving overall equipment performance and reliability.</p>

                            processing. Vibration data from pumps is analyzed using machine learning algorithms to
                            detect signs of wear and tear and predict when maintenance is required.</div>
                        <div class="pred_example2">Predictive maintenance can monitor the condition of motors in
                            industrial applications, such as manufacturing, mining, and power generation. The electrical
                            health of motors is monitored using Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) to detect issues
                            and prevent them from becoming serious problems.</div>

                            looseness, and wear in bearings.</div>
